# Fretboard

**Overview:**   
Fretboard is a web application that aims to help guitar players learn the fretboard and practice scales, intervals, and chords.   

As a guitar player myself, I have always struggled with learning the fretboard and I have always wanted a tool that would help me practice scales, intervals, and chords. I have tried many apps and websites that claim to help with this, but I have always found them to be lacking in some way.  

I therefore decided to build my own tool that is **highly customizable** and **practical** for my daily practice routine. I hope that this tool will be useful for other guitar players as well.

**Development Stack**
- frontend: Typescript, React
- backend: Go, Gin, PostgreSQL
<br><br>

**Currently available features**
1. `Scale Generator`: Generates notes on the guitar fretboard for the chosen root note, position number, and scale type. Toggles between two display modes that shows either note names or intervals.

2. `Interval Generator`: For a chosen root and intervals, generate notes on the fretboard that reflects all notes of the correct interval from the root note. Ideal for practicing patterns on the fretboard and experimenting with chord construction.

**Now working on:** `Chord Generator` - for a chosen root and chord type, display all combinations of chord voicings on the guitar fretboard.
